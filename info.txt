The very first draft of the Dynamical Systems classifier.
We shall see in the near future how it evolve.

This project is inspired by the work of:
- Nizhny Novgorod and Jagiellonian University Dynamical Systems Schools
- Ioannis Kevrekidis, on applications of machine learning to Dynamical Systems
- my PhD thesis, you may want to have a look at it https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk:8443/handle/10044/1/62644
